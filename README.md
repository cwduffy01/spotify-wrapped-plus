# spotify-wrapped-plus
Data analysis using pandas and seaborn to provide more information than what Spotify Wrapped has to offer.

The purpose of this project was to get more practice using the pandas library and data visualization techniques, which I had learned to use during the 2020 winter break. As someone who enjoys listening to music and has an affinity to data analysis, I look forward to Spotify Wrapped every year. However, there is some information that isn't included in Spotify Wrapped that I was curious about discovering, such as what my top 5 most listened to albums were, and when my most listened to song became my most listened to song.

After requesting my data from Spotify Support, I thought it would be interesting to create my own version of Spotify Wrapped and learn more about my taste in music. I requested my listening history data using [these instructions.](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/download-privacy-data-spotify/) My data for 2019 and 2020 is included in this repository, and it includes information that I personally requested through Spotify Support. If you want to run this notebook on your data, you may have to modify the notebook for the columns included in your data.
